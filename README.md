## [Description](#table-of-contents)

This application was created to generate a team profile based on the user input that is entered after answering the questions created with the inquirer module from Node.js. This application demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented-Programming and Test-Driven-Development with Jest.

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

Please download the files from the link below. You can copy these files to a directory in your local computer, or you can also clone it to directory. Open the file in VS Code. You want to make sure that Inqurier, Jest, and Node are installed in your directory.

[Inquirer-Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

After installation is complete, run the following code: ‘node index’ in the terminal. Answer the prompts and after completion, you should see a console log showing your answers to your prompts, a message that says ‘File created!’, and you should see your file called index.html. You can then pull up the team profile card templates in the browser.

I have also included a video with a demo of the project, and I also provided a screenshot.
